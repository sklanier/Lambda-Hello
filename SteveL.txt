Hello! My name is Steve Lanier.
Four words which describe me according to my Myer's-Briggs Test Indicator, ISTP, are introverted, sensing, thinking, and perceiving. I would also add that I am patient.
I enjoy playing Destiny with my brother when I have some free time!

Here is my stretch challenge!
